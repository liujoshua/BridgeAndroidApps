# BridgeAndroidApps

Project that includes mPower and CRF, both building against one instance of BridgeAndroidSDK and ResearchStack. To use, clone this repo.

Run `git submodule init && git submodule update` at root level, but not recursively. (Root gradle is set up to ignore nested BridgeAndroidSDKs and ResearchStack)
